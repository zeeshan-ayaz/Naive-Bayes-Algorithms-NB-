**Overview**

Naive Bayes is a simple yet powerful algorithm for predictive modeling and machine learning, particularly useful for classification tasks such as text classification (spam filtering, sentiment analysis) and other categorical data analysis.

Bayes' Theorem
Naive Bayes is based on Bayes' Theorem, which describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions related to the event. The theorem is represented as:

𝑃
(
𝐴
∣
𝐵
)
=
𝑃
(
𝐵
∣
𝐴
)
⋅
𝑃
(
𝐴
)
𝑃
(
𝐵
)
P(A∣B)= 
P(B)
P(B∣A)⋅P(A)
​
 

Where:

𝑃
(
𝐴
∣
𝐵
)
P(A∣B) is the probability of hypothesis 
𝐴
A given the data 
𝐵
B.
𝑃
(
𝐵
∣
𝐴
)
P(B∣A) is the probability of the data 
𝐵
B given that hypothesis 
𝐴
A is true.
𝑃
(
𝐴
)
P(A) is the probability of hypothesis 
𝐴
A being true (regardless of the data).
𝑃
(
𝐵
)
P(B) is the probability of the data (regardless of the hypothesis).
The 'naive' aspect comes from the assumption that the features used to predict the target variable are independent of each other.

Types of Naive Bayes Classifiers
Gaussian Naive Bayes: Used when features are continuous and normally distributed.
Multinomial Naive Bayes: Often used for document classification, where features are the frequencies of words or tokens in the documents.
Bernoulli Naive Bayes: Used when features are binary (0s and 1s).
Applications
Email spam filtering
Sentiment analysis
Document categorization
Medical diagnosis
